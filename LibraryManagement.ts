// Library Management System

// 1. Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author,
// subject category as well by the publication date.
// 2. Each book will have a unique identification number and other details
// including a rack number which will help to physically locate the book.
// 3. There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members
// should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy
// of a book, a book item.
// 4. The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a
// particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library
// member.
// 5. There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can
// check-out.
// 6. There should be a maximum limit (10) on how many days a member can
// keep a book.
// 7. The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the
// due date.
// 8. Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
// 9. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved
// books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within
// the due date.
// 10. Each book and member card will have a unique barcode. The system will
// be able to read barcodes from books and membersâ€™ library cards.
